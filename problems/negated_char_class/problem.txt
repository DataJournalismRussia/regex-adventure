Write a module that returns true only when:
  the first character is not a digit
  and the second character is not a capital letter.

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    // ...
  }

Negating a character class makes it match the opposite characters.
To negate a character class, include a `^` as the first character inside the
`[]`s.
